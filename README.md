This is the mobile app for  [Tournia](http://www.tournia.net/).


### How to start developing

To view the result in your browser:
```bash
$ ionic serve [--lab]
```

To start developing for a mobile platform:

```bash
$ ionic platform add ios
$ ionic build ios
$ ionic emulate ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac, but if you can, the ios development toolchain is a lot easier to work with until you need to do anything custom to Android.
